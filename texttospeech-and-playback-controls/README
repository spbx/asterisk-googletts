############################################################################
TextToSpeech Module for FreePBX, v2.0.0.0
############################################################################

============================================================================
Description
============================================================================

This module provides the ability to create and manage Text To Speech entries
within FreePBX.  These entries can be used many different ways, of which the
top ones are: As custom system recordings created in the asterisk dir
"sounds/texttospeech/", and as interim destinations where the text will be
spoken and then the user forwarded on to another destination or returned to
an IVR.

The text itself can be statically configured, or fetched from several
different sources such as a text file, a shell command, or a URL.  It can be
configured to synthesize the text once (static mode), or fetch the text
and re-synthesize each time the text-to-speech entry is used (dynamic mode).

The text can be synthesized using one of several different engines, including
Google TTS,Cepstral SWIFT, eSpeak, FLite, and Text2Wave.  

For those of you who have the newer versions of Cepstral SWIFT that does not
include the save-to-file license by default, a dynamic option is provided for
the Cepstral SWIFT engine which will then utilize the Asterisk app_swift
application each time the text-to-speech entry is used.
