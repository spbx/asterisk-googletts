	* engines/engine.php:
	* sources/source.php: Added stderr redirection of 'which' commands to
	null.  This stops the 'command not found' asterisk log messages.

	* engines/swift.engine.php: Use 'which' to find the location of the
	asterisk binary, before checking for the app_swift application.  On some
	systems, it doesn't seem to be in the default PATH.  If not found in the
	default PATH, the AMPBIN directory is checked.

	* sources/url.source.php: Added more specific debug messages for when 
	fetching a URL fails.

	* module.xml: Bumped version to 2.0.0.3, and updated changelog.

	* play_audio.php:
	* play_audio.html.php: Renamed file (added .html on extension), since
	FreePBX 2.9 only supports direct file handlers with this extension

	* helpers/debug.helper.php (New): A copy of my own debugging PHP class

	* helpers/form_helper.php (New): This is a direct copy from FreePBX 2.10.
	This local copy isn't used unless running on FreePBX 2.9.

	* helpers/form.helper.php (New): If FreePBX 2.9 is detected, this sets up
	the things required to include from_helper.php above.  All action is
	skipped if running FreePBX 2.10 or higher.

	* functions.inc.php (Global): Create new default debug class.  Currently
	logs to fpbx-texttospeech.log in the asterisk log folder, and the default
	level is currently VERBOSE for now.  Will change to NOTICE level later.
	Also FreePBX version is checked, and a legacy flag is set if version is
	less then 2.10.

	* functions.inc.php (All Over): Removed usage of original $tts_debug flag,
	and no longer use dbug() unless something drastic went wrong.

	* functions.inc.php (texttospeech_debug_prefix): New function.  Sets up
	prefix used for debugging messages based on the active tts entry.

	* functions.inc.php (texttospeech_process_request):
	* functions.inc.php (texttospeech_modify_entry):
	* functions.inc.php (texttospeech_remove_entry):
	* functions.inc.php (texttospeech_load_entry): Resets the debugging prefix
	once a new entry is loaded

	* page.texttospeech.php (Global): Require the new form.helper, and reset
	the debug prefix once form variables have been parsed

	* module.xml: Changed version to 2.0.0.2, changed dependency to core
	module greater than or equal to 2.9, Updated changelog

	* views/top.php: Just reformatted a little bit when debugging on 2.9

	* views/javascript.php: Split up showing submit progress based on freepbx
	legacy flag.  If Legacy, no progress is indicated.  Progress is still
	indicated on FreePBX 2.10.

	* sources/source.php: Fixed warning being displayed in freepbx debug log

	* engines/*.engine.php, sources/*.source.php: Removed old debugging using
	dbug() function, and now report verbose debugging information to the new
	fpbx-texttospeech.log file
